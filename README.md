**# Data Intepreter Assistant with Voice Support**

A voice-enabled chatbot that interprets natural language queries and provides real-time insights from sales data.

📌 **Problem Statement**

Sales managers and business analysts often deal with large datasets in CSV or Excel formats. Extracting specific insights like "How did the North region perform in March?" typically involves filtering and manual analysis.

**Challenge**:
There is no intuitive and natural way to ask data-related questions in plain English and get immediate insights.

✅ **Our Solution**
Data Interpreter Assistant allows users to ask questions using their voice or text and get instant, human-friendly responses from backend sales data. It mimics the experience of talking to a personal business analyst.

🛠️** Tech Stack**

Layer	Tools Used
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Speech API
Backend	Python, Flask
Voice Input	Web Speech API (Speech-to-Text)
Voice Output	browser’s speechSynthesis API
Data Storage	Static JSON file (sales_data.json)
Deployment	To be hosted (e.g., GitHub Pages + Render)

💡 **Features**
🎤 Voice input and speaker output for true hands-free interaction
🔍 Understands natural language queries like:

"What were the sales in the South region in April?"

"Did we meet the target in February for North?"

📊 Responds with easy-to-understand summaries

⚡ Lightweight, no external LLM API dependency
